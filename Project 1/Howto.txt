Extract "main.rkt" and "dyoo-while-loop.rkt" to the same folder

the dyoo-while-loop.rkt is a racket package that can be found here:
https://github.com/jbclements/while-loop

Open the main.rkt in the DrRacket IDE, press the run button

Go down into the REPL and enter one of the following commands:
(distance Pawn '(8 8) '(15 15))
(distance Bishop '(8 8) '(15 15))
(distance Rook '(8 8) '(10 13) '((7 6) (7 7) (7 8) (3 1) (5 5) (9 12)))

In essence:
(distance [piece] [x, y] [width, height] [[blocked space x,y][blocked space x,y]]) 
	where '(8 8) is actually a list with items '8' '8', and is short hand for (list 8 8)
